# Contributing to material_you_palette

This is the first project I've pushed (publicly) where there is a reasonable expectation that anyone might want to contribute. This is not my first project ever, but all of my work to date has mostly been just hacking at things and trying to learn something new. That being said, I'm not entirely sure where to start other than by first, thanking you for taking the time to contribute or at least consider it! :tada: Hopefully this project will get a little more attention than just passing curiosity and together we can make it better and more useful. Should this take wings, I have zero intentions of running it entirely by myself and certainly not as a dictator. I am open to suggestions for improvements and learning new things. So, we'll start this off (hopefully on a good foot) with some really basic guidelines and grow from there.

### Basic Rules<a id="rules"></a>

First some basic rules that I have for my all my dev teams. They have served me and my teams very well for years. They just might serve well here.

1. **Don't be rude, even if you're right.**
    > Especially if you're right because being rude just makes you wrong in a whole different way. Being rude takes up energy and mental cycles that could be better spent on finding solutions. People are bound to make mistakes or offer bad suggestions. If there are sound, non-emotionally charged and non-biased reasons for rejecting an idea, please present them calmly and politely. If mistakes are made, attempt to address those directly to the person who made the mistake, privately if at all possible, and politely explain what the mistake was and how to correct it. Public humiliation will not be tolerated.
2. **Everyone has something of value to offer. Our job as a team is to find the nugget and give it a shine.**
    > I've worked with junior coders and non-devs who have offered up some of the most ingenious ideas which turned into exceptional solutions once time was taken to understand the thoughts. Everyone is busy. But we can make wonderful things happen if we slow down or even stop briefly once in a while to reflect on what has been done and politely discuss what we want to do. Doing so will allow us to proceed with confidence.
3. **Use common sense and kindness when coding, testing or supporting our work.**
    > When coding, if there is a common principle like how Rust has the concept of "idiomatic Rust", use it. If there is an "Angular way" to do a thing, that's the way we should be doing it. Often times, there are very, very good reasons for following these practices. This said, I am a bit of a stickler for the OTB (One-True Brace) style of coding for good reason, not just because I'm the product of learning to program in the late 80s / early 90s. However, I'm not going to go full-on Richard Hendricks (see the Silicon Valley show from HBO) over this OR spaces over tabs. Thankfully, that's because this is a Rust project and I already like the way `cargo fmt` does things.
    >
    >Being kind when coding refers to leaving quality code comments whenever possible, cleaning up debug statements and other little messes we often leave behind. This is just good project stewardship, good practice and very likely, kind to your future self. Not to mention someone else will may come back to it at some point and they might just know where you live. :-)
4. **"WIP" is not an acceptable commit statement. Use conventional commit messages instead.**
    >First, all code projects are "work in progress" so WIP is a **Big Ol' Bucket-o-Duh:tm:**. Committing "work in progress" to a work in progress is redundant, useless and redundant. [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) are a clean, standard way to provide all the information necessary to convey. Let's use those.
5. **No man is an island and no one knows everything.**
    >Individually, we may be pretty smart. Cooperatively, we a freaking geniuses. I know enough to be very dangerous, but there are certainly things I don't know (yet) and my approach may not always be best. That even covers the first few points here. If there are things we can do better and should document them, then by all means let's discuss them and get things set in place.

### Project Goals<a id="goals"></a>

I try to outline project goals very clearly at the start of every thing I or my teams have done. We may not have all the requirements or designs right away, but we do have some basic boundaries set in order to reduce, if not eliminate, scope creep. In the case of this project, I have defined the goals in the [README.md](./README.md#goals). Let's do our best to color within the lines and if necessary, move additional features or design ideas to a whole new page, i.e. a project of its own. Can you tell I've had kids?
